DreamZilla
========
DreamZilla is a simple PHP application that uses an API Key that the Dreamhost user provides and it requests the list of FTP/SFTP/SSH users that Dreamhost user has in their account and generates an XML file to download and import into FileZilla's Site Manager for easy connection to your various users/sites.

A live version is able to be seen here: http://www.kenmoini.com/dropBox/dreamzilla/
